## Work: Execution

### Core Principle
Execute the task exactly as specified in `plan.md`. No improvisation.

### Execution Steps

#### 1. Follow Plan Precisely
```
task = current_step_from_plan.md
expected_output = task.outputs
success_criteria = task.success_criteria

perform(task)
```

#### 2. Create Artifacts Strictly in Workdir
- All files created → `workdir/`
- All code written → `workdir/`
- All tests run → `workdir/`
- No outputs outside workdir

#### 3. Validate While Working
- Run tests incrementally (don't wait until end)
- Catch errors early
- Fix immediately (don't propagate bad state)
- Document blockers as they appear

#### 4. Track What You Do
- Log each step
- Note decisions made
- Record any deviations from plan
- Time each phase (helps future estimates)

#### 5. Fail Fast, Escalate Quickly
If you get blocked:
1. Try 2-3 recovery approaches
2. If still blocked → stop and report to orchestrator
3. Don't spend hours on unsolvable problems
4. Provide: blocker description, what you tried, recommendation

### Success Indicators
✓ All outputs in workdir/
✓ Artifacts match expected outputs
✓ Success criteria met
✓ No errors or warnings (unless documented)
✓ Clear worklog entry

### Failure Indicators
✗ Task incomplete or partially done
✗ Files outside workdir
✗ Success criteria not met
✗ Hidden errors or technical debt
✗ No clear reason for failure
