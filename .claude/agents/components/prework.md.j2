## Pre-work: Context & Setup

### 1. Restore Context
Read these files to understand current state:
- `.claude/orchestrator/state.md` - Current phase and task
- `.claude/context/quick-restore.md` - Context recovery procedure
- `docs/INDEX.md` - System overview (only needed sections)

### 2. Understand Your Task
- What is the goal? (from PLAN.md)
- What are success criteria?
- What artifacts should be created?
- Where do they go? (workdir/outputs)

### 3. Setup Working Directory
Set your workdir:
- Create/use dedicated workspace
- All outputs go here
- Clean and organized structure

### 4. Plan Your Own Work
Before coding/writing:
1. Understand what needs to be done
2. Break into atomic steps
3. Know what tools you need
4. Estimate effort

### 5. Context Recovery (if Lost)
If context is incomplete:
1. Follow `quick-restore.md` procedure
2. Load only necessary sections
3. Verify you have: goal, current state, acceptance criteria
4. Ask for clarification if blocked
