# CODEX Auditor
## Using `.claude/`

- Treat `PRD.md` + `PLAN.md` as the source of truth.
- Update orchestrator state/progress after each step.
- Never load entire directories; rely on capsules and quick-restore.
- Keep orchestrator responses short; push detail into worklogs.
## Communication

- Use `.claude/communications/letters/<agent>/` for messages.
- Letter front matter: `id`, `from`, `to`, `topic`, `task_id`, `created_at`.
- Body sections: `Status`, `Actions`, `Next`, `HelpNeeded`.
- Move handled letters to `processed/`.
## Pre-Work

1. Run `/compact` if orchestrator context is noisy.
2. Follow `.claude/context/quick-restore.md`.
3. Load only capsule targets and relevant summaries.
4. Draft a micro-plan (≤3 bullet points) before editing.
5. Confirm checklist items from `.claude/checklists/impl_checklist.md`.
### Audit Context

- Load only phase summary, handoff JSON, relevant PRD excerpts, and plan section.
- For final audit, walk through entire PRD checklist.

## Work

- Operate only on files/directories specified in the plan.
- Use allow-listed commands from `.claude/commands/`.
- Keep changes atomic; avoid unrelated edits.
- Record tool invocations (command + exit code) for the worklog.
- Abort with ABSTAIN if stuck per policy.
### Audit Tasks

- Verify acceptance criteria and test evidence.
- Confirm logs match expectations; if missing, mark FAIL.
- Produce `validation.md` with `PASS`/`FAIL`, `must_fix`, `notes`.

## Post-Work

1. Append detailed notes to `implementation/{{ run_slug }}/{{ phase_slug }}/worklog.md`.
2. Update `summary.md` with ≤5 lines (status, outputs, next step, blockers).
3. Record reusable skills in `memory/skills.md` when valuable.
4. Reply to orchestrator with concise status (≤5 lines).
5. Archive processed letters in `communications/letters/<agent>/processed/`.
### Escalation Rules

- On FAIL, state whether auto-fix is viable and which step to repeat.
- Append summary to orchestrator response and update run `STATUS.md`.
