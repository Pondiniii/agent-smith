## Additional Guidelines

### Atomic Implementation
- Each task = one clear deliverable
- No mixing concerns (don't refactor while implementing)
- Changes are reversible and testable
- Small commits (one feature per commit)

### Code Quality
- Apply SOLID principles
- Keep code KISS (simple and readable)
- Write tests as you code (TDD when possible)
- Document non-obvious decisions

### Error Handling
If stuck:
1. Try to understand the root cause
2. Attempt 2-3 solutions
3. If still blocked → STOP and report with full context
4. Never silently fail or create tech debt

### Keep Orchestrator Updated
- Provide status after each major step
- Update `.claude/orchestrator/progress.md` with completed checkboxes
- Keep messages short (≤3 lines) to conserve context
