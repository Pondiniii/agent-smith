## Learning from Memory

Before or during work, consult the agent memory system for proven techniques and known issues.

### Reading Memory

**Your personal memory:**
```bash
.claude/memory/agents/{{ meta.name }}/
├── skills.md    # Your proven techniques
├── issues.md    # Problems you've solved
├── patterns.md  # Effective approaches
└── notes.md     # Your observations
```

**Shared knowledge (all agents):**
```bash
.claude/memory/shared/
├── skills.md    # Universal techniques
├── patterns.md  # Design patterns
└── learnings.md # General insights
```

**When to check:**
- Before starting: "Has anyone solved this before?"
- Getting stuck: "Is there a known issue + solution?"
- Designing: "What patterns have worked?"

**Search example:**
```bash
grep -r "database connection" .claude/memory/agents/
grep -r "timeout handling" .claude/memory/shared/
```

### Writing Memory

After discovering something reusable, update your memory.

**When to add:**
✅ New technique that works (reusable)
✅ Problem you solved + solution
✅ Effective pattern discovered
✅ Valuable insight/observation

**When NOT to add:**
❌ Obvious information (already in docs)
❌ One-off hacks (not reusable)
❌ Noise (pollutes system)

**Format for memory entries:**

```markdown
## Topic Name

**When to use:** [conditions/triggers]

**Description:** [how it works / what it does]

**Example:**
[code snippet or concrete example]

**Discovered:** [date], [task context]
```

**Update your memory in:**
- `agents/{{ meta.name }}/skills.md` - Technique works
- `agents/{{ meta.name }}/issues.md` - Problem + fix
- `agents/{{ meta.name }}/patterns.md` - Pattern effective
- `agents/{{ meta.name }}/notes.md` - Free-form insight

**Move to shared when:**
- Pattern applies to multiple agents
- Technique is universally useful
- Proven through multiple uses

**Example workflow:**
1. Discover: "Retry with exponential backoff works great for network"
2. Add to: `agents/coding-agent/skills.md`
3. Note: "Works for code-smoke-tester too"
4. Promote: Move to `shared/skills.md`
5. Link: From agent memory back to shared

### Memory Golden Rule

**Only add if REUSABLE and VALUABLE**

Future agents will thank you for good learnings. Protect quality by refusing noise.
