# Shared Memory Index

Cross-agent reusable knowledge.

## Skills

Techniques discovered and proven to work:
- See: [skills.md](./skills.md)

## Patterns

Design patterns and solutions:
- See: [patterns.md](./patterns.md)

## Learnings

General insights and principles:
- See: [learnings.md](./learnings.md)

## Adding to Shared

Move from agent-specific memory when:
1. Pattern works for multiple agents
2. Technique is universally applicable
3. Proven through multiple uses

Process:
1. Extract from `agents/[agent]/...`
2. Generalize for all agents
3. Add to `shared/skills.md` or `shared/patterns.md`
4. Link back in agent memory for reference
